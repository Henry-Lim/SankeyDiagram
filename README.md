# Sankey Diagram Web Application

This Sankey Diagram Web Application was developed for the Graphical Representation of Homelessness project for It Takes a City and Embrace Cambridge. The idea is to utilise interactive Sankey Diagrams to study the movement patterns of homeless people and understand the causes of loops in the system.
